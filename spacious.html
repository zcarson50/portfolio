        <h1>Spacious Overview</h1>
        <p>A simple application to help users to find and sell parking spots in their area</p>
    </section>

    <h2>Initial Design Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Simplify the process of finding short-term or long-term parking in busy locations.</li>
      <li>Provide clear, upfront pricing and availability before committing.</li>
      <li>Create a fast, frictionless flow that works well on web or mobile in the moment of need.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Scenarios:</strong> Last-minute parking before a concert (short-term); commuter reserving a monthly space (long-term).</li>
      <li>Figuring out how users would be updated on open spots, how to incentivize those updates</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prototyping and Testing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Developed a high-fidelity prototype in highlighting real-time availability and upfront pricing.</li>
      <li>Conducted usability testing: focused on how quickly users could complete a reservation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Insights and Learnings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Shifted away from real-time public parking to strictly purchasing private spots, due to lack of incentive</li>
      <li>This means switching from "push" model (users send spot updates whenever they want) to a "pull" model (users only post a spot when they want to sell it)</li>
      <li>Mobile -> Web application (React.js, Vercel deployment), for increased accessibility across devices</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reflections and Post-Mortem</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>What worked:</strong> Simplified flow, decision for a web application, inclusion of Firebase for persistent data</li>
      <li><strong>What didnâ€™t:</strong> Real-time parking integration, trying to create a voluntary "push" model in the design</li>
      <li><strong>Takeaway:</strong> It's better spend more time and have a strong plan upfront, in order to prevent making major changes and redesigns</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Giving Credit</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Design inspiration: Parkmobile (competitor), Uber (for map view), AirBnb (concept comparison)</li>
      <li>Map screenshots/icons used in prototype credited for demo purposes.</li>
    </ul>
