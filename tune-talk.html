    <h1>TuneTalk Overview</h1>
    <p>Music is deeply social, but most streaming platforms emphasize consumption over conversation. While people share playlists, there isn’t a widely adopted platform for reviewing and discovering music through social interaction — the way Letterboxd did for film. TuneTalk explores this gap by combining music streaming with a social layer of reviews, ratings, and discovery.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Research:</strong> Conducted contextual inquiries into how subjects listen to music, what apps they use, points of struggle and confusion, and new features/fixes that they would like to see.</li>
        <li><strong>Market/Exemplar Research:</strong> Studied Letterboxd (film reviews) and Goodreads (books). Key inspiration: simple rating systems + community-driven critique.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Create a social hub for music reviews where users can rate, write reviews, and discuss music.</li>
        <li>Help people discover music through peer recommendations.</li>
        <li>Keep interface lightweight and mobile-friendly for quick posting and browsing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Personas:</strong> Insert description </li>
        <li><strong>Scenarios:</strong> Insert Description </li>
        <li>Sketching, brainstorming, and wireframing the review feed, album pages, and profile flows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Prototyping and Testing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to map user flows.</li>
        <li>High-fidelity prototype with album artwork, clean typography, and interaction cues.</li>
        <li>Unmoderated and moderated user-testing: allowing users to go through the app, gathered their feedback</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Insights and Learnings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Users value both depth and speed: short ratings for quick logging, long reviews for discussion.</li>
        <li>Social recommendations drive discovery more than algorithms alone.</li>
        <li>Playback integration with streaming APIs considered for MVP but deferred for scope.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Reflections and Post-Mortem</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>What worked:</strong> Concept validation — participants saw clear value over existing apps.</li>
        <li><strong>What didn’t:</strong> Original plan was too ambitious — complex review and playback features.</li>
        <li><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Social critique can meaningfully drive discovery; even small communities matter.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Giving Credit</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Design inspiration: Letterboxd, Goodreads, Spotify (visual language)</li>
        <li>Album artwork used in prototype credited for demo purposes.</li>
    </ul>
